    <h1>What is the future work?</h1>
    <p>Recently, the WeiXin public number TalentGuide made an article that everyone in the future are likely to become multiple occupations. What does that mean? That is to say you can not only do a job, or outside of work, do what you like to do, with their skills to obtain additional income. The article says so, mainly because of the following four important social trends:</p>
    <p><strong>The first trend</strong>: The future service industry will slowly become the largest industry, including education, health and entertainment, culture, art, tourism, and so on. This industry requires a lot of talent. Service industry and traditional industries are not the same. It does not involve production, there is no long industrial chain, do not need large-scale cooperation, and even you can become a service provider. Especially the development of the Internet, so that information is more smooth, and this time, between individuals and individuals can trade. For example, if you register for an Airbnb, you can make your home a hotel, register a Uber, you can make money as a taxi. The other like any sports fitness, education, private kitchen food, beauty nail massage, travel services, knowledge sharing, fashion buyers and other shopping platform, as long as you have the skills, you can directly provide services to users.</p>
    <p><strong>The second trend</strong>: We have entered a period of knowledge and creativity, today's society, talent is more important than land and capital. We all know that the past production is by money, money, you can buy land, build factories, hire workers, thus creating huge profits. But now the money is not a panacea. In particular, the mobile Internet industry, financing at every turn billions of dollars, tens of millions of levels of financing is simply not worth mentioning, and entrepreneurial companies into the money, almost all hit the engineers who, that is, you have to spend money to hire talent. Wait until the Internet infrastructure to build, it becomes a time to fight the content, and improve efficiency you can rely on technology, but the completion of the transaction, to create value, you have high-quality content, to meet the needs of users of the product, Products, and ultimately to a group of knowledge and creative talent to complete.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>The third trend</strong>: The future work will be more in a cooperative manner. In the past, in the era of capital economy, where we work is fixed, because people need to be managed. But in the era of knowledge and creativity, you want to be creative, by management does not work, can only rely on self-driven. Take Silicon Valley, employees have a lot of freedom, you can choose who to work, join the project, where to work, and when to work.
        The future of the growing demand for talent, you can choose more and more work in the past that the way of employment, it is likely to become a cooperative way, that is, you no longer hire good talent Unless you cooperate with him.
        Moreover, when talent becomes a critical resource, if you are a scarce talent, your worth will rise, the profit will be re-allocated from the capital to the talent here. So, if you are better, your skills are less likely to be replaced, the less limited you are, and who you are doing, how much you say, how long to work every day, the price is, the initiative is in you.
    </p>
    <p>The last trend is that today the society is paying more and more attention to the opportunity of knowledge. LuoJiSiWei is the &quot;knowledge service providers&quot;, the knowledge into a mass consumer goods, but also a lot of excellent knowledge owners to &quot;front&quot;, so that they become knowledge producers. Many young people, in the past show &quot;luxury&quot;, now began to show &quot;reading list&quot;, and spare time are using knowledge to charge. At the same time, young people do not have to rely on family background or financial resources, as long as you enrich yourself, have strength, talent, you can get the opportunity to show their skills.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the most important investment in this era, should be <strong>&quot;self-investment&quot;</strong>. As long as you have sufficient knowledge, talent or skills, you can have multiple occupations and identity, you can live a more interesting and more economical and independent life.</p>
