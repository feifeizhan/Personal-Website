    <h1>Xiao Zhixing: What is the management?</h1>
    <p>We all know that management is a profound and profound knowledge. In life, to manage a good company, down to manage a team, not so easy. So what is management in the end? Why is it so hard to manage? Recently, Peking University HSBC Leadership Research Center Director Xiao Zhixing, in the teaching and training workshop made a speech, elaborated on the three characteristics of management, learning management of the three dimensions, as well as learning management in China need to cross the two gaps. </p>
    <p><strong>First of all,</strong> we say that the management of the three characteristics of what.</p>
    <p><strong>The first feature,</strong> management is anti-natural. The law of nature is the principle of entropy increase, that is, unless the input of energy from the outside, otherwise an isolated system of the order will always be slowly to collapse. For example, a glass of boiling water will slowly become cold water, and this process is irreversible. Unless you rehearse it, otherwise the cold water will not change back to boiling water. The same reason, you like a restaurant, but the second year in the past, you will find that you love the dish that is not so delicious before; you like a hotel, the fifth, sixth To live, you find that the carpet becomes dirty, the wallpaper began to fall off, the bathroom began to leak, and these are entropy increase principle. And the purpose of management is to curb this cool, worse process, so it is anti-natural.</p>
    <p><strong>Second,</strong> management is anti-human, it requires managers to have some contrary to the nature of human nature. For example, people naturally like to blame the shortcomings of others, this is human nature. But as a manager, but must see the strengths of others, so as to bring out the excellent team. For example, as an ordinary person, we generally like to express their ability, like to succeed. But as a manager, you can not be able to succeed, you can only give, try to make their own subordinates feel that he is very capable, you can be regarded as a qualified manager. So management is anti-human.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Third,</strong> management is anti-historical. There is a saying that the world event, for a long time will be divided, For an enterprise is the same, it always has a day, this is the law of history. However, the manager's task is to violate the laws of history, so that their own business later than others disappear. The manager is like the Greek mythology was punished Sisyphus, the stone constantly falling, he will continue to push the stone again.
        We come to say, learning management of the three dimensions.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>The first dimension: <strong>management is a craft</strong>, management of good and bad, depends entirely on the managers sense of sense of proportionality. For example, to a manager of a specific situation, he can immediately determine the number of variables here, the most important variables are listed, and then give these variables sort, scoring, for example: &quot;out of 100 points, A variable Accounting for 60 points, B variable accounted for 30 points, C variable accounted for 10 points, this time to find the best solution. Moreover, all rely on the intuitive judgments, so that management is a hand, no certain The perception and the accumulation of a long time, can not do.</p>
    <p>The second dimension, <strong>management is a liberal arts</strong>. Burson Marsteller is the essence of Western culture, the best universities in the West, all stressed that they do is liberal arts education, is to train a person to speak, to debate, to maintain their own and national rights and interests. It is essentially a fight on the understanding of human nature and insight. So, management master Drucker also said that management is a liberal arts.</p>
    <p>The third dimension, and the hardest part, is that **management is a kind of religion **that requires a mission-driven mechanism. Most people are passionate about money, beauty and status, but for a cause, a value will not have the same passion. This is like, for ordinary people, handsome beauty from the front, we will see more glances, praise a few words. However, for a manager, it is best to see talented people from their own front, but also have this physiological response Caixing.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Finally, we talk about, in China, learning management needs to cross the two gaps. Xiao Zhixing said, learning management of people, 99% will be stowed inside the two gaps.</p>
    <p>The first is the gap <strong>between theory and practice</strong>. For example, learn the management of people who know the organizational chart, probably means to report to who made a chart. However, most people do not understand the essence of this picture. Do you see who decides who's working on the job, who decides who's the salary is over of course not. The essence of the question is who and who has the same goal. In theory, A reports to B that the goals of A and B must be consistent. But in fact, managers did not do this effort. Many managers even with the subordinate one-on-one dialogue have not had, then how to expect a map, subordinates will be consistent with your goal? Therefore, the manager must figure out what the subordinate work objectives, how many of the intersection between you, how to expand or reduce, this theory is put into practice.</p>
    <p>For example, many bosses like to take the multinational company's interview question back, directly to the HR interview, but very few HR will use these questionnaires. The reason is: HR to enjoy the power of pleasure ah! In fact, the vast majority of HR in the interview, the first minute had decided to do this person, and the rest of the time, he is in their own persuasion of their own judgment is correct. Determine the fate of a person, which is the source of pleasure of HR rights, but if you deprive this right, with a questionnaire to replace his role, who would be willing to do?</p>
    <p>
        The second gap is the gap between <strong>the East and the West</strong>. Xiao Zhixing found that many Chinese enterprises are learning the management of the West, but may not apply to China. For example, ten years ago, all the people are learning Jack Welch, learning how to turn a large company into a small company. However, we do not know is that General Electric is the world's system, the most complete process, but also the most cumbersome company, so Jack Welch should advocate simple, speed, think of ways to GM with a small company's flexibility. But China's private enterprises do, in fact, the lack of institutions, systems and processes. If this time to blindly learn Welch, it is diametrically opposed. This is like: people nutrient surplus, eat to card the calorie content, and you do, has been for three consecutive months did not eat a meal, but also to let their attention to health, eat more vegetables, which is court death. So, the gap between East and West culture is also very terrible.
        You see, manage this thing, just touch the time that is very simple, but more pondering the more complex. Hope that Xiao Zhixing referred to the above points on the management of knowledge, can help you stroked ideas, better understanding and learning management.
