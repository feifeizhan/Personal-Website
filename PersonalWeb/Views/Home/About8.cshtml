    <h1>How is Elon Musk looking for entrepreneurial direction</h1>
    <p>Elon Musk is one of the business giants of our time. He was the founder of Paypal, the world's largest online payment company, and later the CEO of the private space launch company SpaceX, the electric car company Tesla. Recently, he set up a new company - &quot;<strong>nerve weaving</strong>&quot;, the company's goal is to study how to make people's thinking directly into the computer.</p>
    <p>Musk is so explained this business: now people have been electronic, and we are very accustomed to using e-mail, computers and mobile phones, so that they have formed a part of our lives, but people are far behind with intelligence On the development of artificial intelligence, a prominent performance is that the input and output are not equal. For example, our eyes can read a lot of information at lightning speed, and we can only hand on the keyboard clumsy and slowly typing to output ideas. Obviously, the output capacity of the increase there is a huge space.</p>
    <p>Musk judgment, the future, human intelligence and artificial intelligence will go to the merger. This time, Musk wants to create a &quot;nerve weaving network&quot; that is to make people's thoughts directly uploaded to the computer, thus completely breaking the bandwidth, including the keyboard, mouse and touch pad, including the current input method.</p>
    <p>You may be amazed, how can there be a Musk whimsy? In fact, from a longer time dimension, his business follows two laws, which is the way every entrepreneur can learn from.</p>
    <p>The first law is: <strong>first principle</strong>. In simple terms, the &quot;first principle&quot; is to think about the world with the eyes of physics, to abandon all the existing stereotypes, a layer of stripping appearance, directly from the essence of thinking. </p>
    <p>
        For example, he does electric car Tesla, a lot of people feel impossible to make, because the battery cost is too high. Musk said, I no matter how expensive the battery now, back to the essence of a question, what is the composition of the hard cost of the battery? Nothing is iron, nickel, aluminum these metals, in addition to these costs is absolutely not down, and the remaining costs are generated during the process of human collaboration, then there is room for optimization. For example, in the United States production tax may be relatively high, then do not in the United States produced. In this way, it is possible for us to limit the price of the battery to the price of these metals themselves.
        The same idea, &quot;nerve weaving&quot; this project once again the use of the first principle: first return to the most essential issues: human input is not equal. How is it unequal? Input mode is limited, the existing input only the keyboard, mouse and touch pad, the need for people's brain first hand, hand to the keyboard and mouse input information, enter the information and then converted into computer language, in order to complete a set of input The So, the middle of these processes can not be optimized? Can I directly use a line to complete the brain signal and computer signal conversion? This is the first principle in the use of this innovative project.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the first-nature principle, Musk also has an important business law: This is the first grand founder of the company, but first from the application of products cut into, and explore <strong>how to combine with the business</strong>. Such as SpaceX and Tesla, are starting from the application of recent products to start, for the grand design to lay a sustainable development path. For example, SpaceX's grand goal is to <strong>let the average person boarded Mars</strong>, but starting from <strong>the recovery of the rocket business</strong>; Tesla's grand goal is to produce a reasonable price, long-distance driving unmanned electric vehicles, but also from the manufacture of high-end Of the electric car starting.</p>
    <p>&quot;Nerve weaving network&quot; this business idea is the same. Mask's long-term vision is the combination of human brain enhancement and man-machine, and the company's <strong>first task is to first find the entry point in the traditional science, implanting electrodes in the human brain to treat the disease</strong>. The first step is to implant the electrode in the human brain, the second step is to collect and amplify the brain nerve signal, because the brain waves is very weak, the third step is the brain signal output and decoding, this technology for the treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson and other brain disorders are valuable. Let the &quot;nerve weaving network&quot; from the application of the product cut, to overcome this obstacle, the man-machine connection this seemingly unimaginable goal will no longer distant.</p>
    <p>To sum up, Musk's business has two laws: first, with the <strong>first principle</strong> of the formation of creativity; second, from the practical application of the beginning, to seek <strong>commercial channels</strong> for the grand goal to provide sustainable road.</p>
