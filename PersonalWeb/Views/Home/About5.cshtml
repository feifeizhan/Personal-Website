    <h1>United Airlines crisis</h1>
    <p>A few days ago, we may have heard of a news: April 9, 2017, United Airlines, a plane because of ultra-ticket sales (that is, tickets sold more), and the airline has four crew members need to sit here Class aircraft, so ask if there is no volunteer willing to take the initiative to the plane. By the computer to take four passengers off the plane, which is forced. One of the passengers did not resist the resistance, the airport security to hard, forced him to drag the plane, resulting in the passenger was injured.This is caused in the United States uproar, Chinese people feel strange, the United States is not a developed country, do not engage in a market economy? The customer is not God, how can treat customers like that?</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Weigang Wan</strong> teacher said that for more than a decade, American Airlines' service quality has been declining. Indeed, when I was in the United States by plane, the experience is very bad, as domestic airlines have seductive stewardess, it would also like to think about it.
        Of course, the development of such as the United States such as the degree of abuse of passengers, but also created a new level, then why?Weigang Gan teacher said that the main reason is that ticket prices have been declining, the airline is to improve the standard of service, there is no financial resources. The United States has a home company, 2016 would like to improve the service, the results immediately decline in profits. Passenger satisfaction, but the Wall Street stock market quit, the service upgrade to the CEO is very dissatisfied with the company's share price fell more than 30%. Then we further ask, if the general industry, service quality and price, although a contradiction, but there will always be a balance point, right? Why in the US aviation industry, the fare seems to fall in endlessly, the service seems to be endless break the bottom line?
    </p>
    <p><strong>First</strong>, travel in the United States can only rely on aircraft, unlike China has high-speed rail, so the aviation industry nothing to compete.<strong>Second,</strong> each passenger is very few times a year by plane, 90% of US passengers, once a year to take a plane. Consumption frequency so little, basically no brand loyalty problem, there is no &quot;repeat customer effect&quot;, then why should enhance the service? This is like the train station in China's business, basically the quality is not good, this is a reason.<strong>Third,</strong>the passengers on the plane anyway, also a few hours. Americans income these years also nothing to improve, so the price is very sensitive, would rather be low, not critical of what a good service.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>But the next day, I met our **Ziyang Li **teacher. He said that the explanation of the Weigang Wan teacher is very reliable, but the quality of service to the United States fell to this point, in fact, there is another important reason: is the actual control of United Airlines, in fact, the company's employees, not capitalists. Wonder how this is going on? Originally in 1994, the United States to 55% of the company's shares sold to employees, of course, is half to sell half, the exchange of conditions for employees to pay wages and benefits to make concessions. Such a large company, employees have more than half of the shares, which in history is the first time. But this approach is in line with the values ​​of some people at the time, they think that since the enterprise is the staff, and that employees will of course cherish, help each other. The real result is that the company's control by employees, employees continue to ask for wages, disobedient CEO must get out. The company has become a &quot;big pot&quot; to improve service quality, improve the company's competitiveness, of course, is not the company's primary appeal.From this incident you can see, let the four passengers off the plane, is to replace the four airline employees. Service passengers is second, employee satisfaction is the first, it happened that the abuse of passengers, of course, not surprising.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Then, I heard the third explanation, the source of this perspective is <strong>Yuquan Wang</strong> teacher said that the United States this incident, in fact, it is difficult to say that the United States of the Fallen, in fact, maybe or a progress.The United States is a highly automated society, you see the social operation in an orderly manner, in fact, behind a large number of automation technology support. For example, you buy things in the US supermarket, the supermarket cashier does not need a high education, do not need complex training, you can work. Their work standards, not their decision by their own, but by the supermarket automation system to ensure that.This degree of automation, in recent years because of the Internet, artificial intelligence, large data technology development, more by leaps and bounds. This creates a situation in the United States: the social workers at the bottom of society, society does not need them to improve their own labor skills.There is a famous word to say: &quot;These people should be smart enough to operate the machine and skilled paper on the homework, but also stupid enough to be able to accept all those poor work.</p>
    <p>United is no exception, to know that the United States, after all, is the largest US airline, it can be worse where to go bad. Every day thousands of flights, behind all the operations are automated systems. Like the situation inside the event: the ticket overbook, which is the computer and large data decisions; to voluntarily take off the aircraft how much compensation, but also computer and large data decisions; no one volunteered to choose what kind of people forced to let it went down, which is allowed by law, the specific candidates are also computer and large data decisions.</p>
    <p>
        When will it be used? That is, drag the people down the link, these security, that is, we just said that the United States the bottom of the workers, their quality is not, so it happened to beat, abuse the passengers of the incident. So, the whole nature of this matter is a bug in American society, a small flaw. Is in the society more and more automated, artificial intelligence, large data in the process, there will be some occasional defects.
        The probability of these things is very small, each year about 40,000 passengers in the United States is in this involuntary situation was out of the plane. United is not the most, like Southwest Airlines, last year drove to 15,000 passengers, the probability is one ten thousandth, is twice as much as United. The incident was only because the United unlucky, met a more real passengers, and two will not come to the security, led to a bleeding, and then detonated the media attention, nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>According to Wang Yuquan teacher analysis of this angle, with the artificial intelligence, large data technology to further the development of such tragedies more and more can be avoided. For example, if the big data can monitor each passenger's other data, will know what kind of passengers more submissive, what kind of passengers may be intense resistance, then this will not happen.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
        You see, Wang Yuquan teacher to provide this observation angle is also very interesting.
        When it comes here, what I really want to say today is coming - On the interpretation of a phenomenon, there is no certain accurate answer, we have to pursue is not a definite truth, but a more diverse cognitive perspective. These seemingly contradictory angles should coexist in our perceptions, rather than letting them fight, and have to separate them from one level up and down.
        You see, Weigang Wan,Ziyang Li, Yuquan Wang from the <strong>market evolution</strong>, <strong>business system</strong> and <strong>technological progress</strong> from three angles, providing the same thing three explanations. Between these explanations, there is no difference between the merits and demerits, we can accept at the same time, and then learn by analogy, to use this perspective to the other things on the analysis.
        This is what our lifelong learners should take.
