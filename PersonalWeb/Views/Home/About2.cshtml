    <h1>Chinese entrepreneurs are generally encountered psychological difficulties</h1>
    <p>Today talk to you about the Chinese entrepreneurs are generally encountered psychological difficulties, and restraint of their methods.</p>
    <p>In general, a successful entrepreneur often has a lot of good qualities, such as flexible, dare to dare to dry, hands and so on. But you believe that, if the lack of strong heart, these characteristics one day may become a hindrance to the development of the company.</p>
    <p>Recently, the co-founder of the assistant professor, management scholar Xiao Zhixing, published such a point of view, he believes that when the enterprise to achieve a major breakthrough, the general turnover of more than 1 billion yuan when the founder of all the strengths will be bite, The biggest obstacle to growth. The reason why this is because the entrepreneur's own     entrepreneurial power system problems.</p>
    <p>Entrepreneurial power system, that is, the driving force behind entrepreneurship, in the West, entrepreneurs uphold the Puritan tradition, in their view, entrepreneurship is a means to achieve life salvation, not just a simple money or the pursuit of a sense of accomplishment.But in China, because of the lack of religious tradition, do not attach importance to spiritual life, which makes the driving force of entrepreneurship, confined to the real material level, it is not difficult to explain why many entrepreneurs once made money, then stop pursue.</p>
    <p>Such as poverty, entrepreneurs born poor, leaving the psychological debt. Early years of poor people, it is easy to produce an unavoidable wealth, completely irrational possessive. Make money itself is nothing wrong, the desire for money is also commonplace, but when the business to a certain extent, if the money and equity to see so heavy, even more than their own business, it is certainly a problem The.</p>
    <p>Xiao Zhixing that the degree of excellence of enterprises, and many times the proportion of the number of shares and inversely proportional, such as Huawei, Ren Zhengfei only 1.4% of their own shares, as well as Vanke, Tencent, Alibaba, etc., leaders have not equity as all.</p>
    <p>Another example is the lack of emotion, that is, entrepreneurs early feelings of cold, resulting in excessive compensation. Many of the young entrepreneurs, are in the broken family grew up, and even never had loved ones care. Which makes it very natural to put their emotions in the brotherhood, very sense of obligation. Even if the entrepreneurial veteran not performance, do not abide by the rules, very unreasonable time, the founder will again and again, high lift, gently put down, the result is the enterprise to develop a variety of rules, from the value to the strategy, from the system To the process, all in vain, become a joke.</p>
    <p>There are entrepreneurs, the heart is extremely lack of identity, because the early years were despised, leading to over-desire for praise. Some poorly born entrepreneurs, from an early age was looked down on, it is easy after the success of the business, too concerned about the industry, government and social evaluation, so spend a lot of time to do all kinds of association chairman, to participate in various awards, Leadership, etc. Once these things addictive, it will be very time-consuming and laborious, the company's business, it is often difficult to take into account.</p>
    <p>There are a child when the power of bullying, after the success of business like to make a combination of power, and even collusion with power. When a child to eat on the Dayton Dayton Dayton, after the business like nothing, control everything. A child was deceived, and grew up and others can not establish long-term trust relationship and so on. All of which will give the enterprise the seeds of the crisis. These demons, which can be a business to ruin, not to mention the hearts of many entrepreneurs, but also lived at several demons, turns into battle.</p>
    <p>So, how can the entrepreneur control these demons? Xiao Zhixing that, for this generation of self-made entrepreneurs, it is important to overcome their own origin, to overcome their own lack of a variety of sense, and strive to make their own noble up. This noble, and wealth has nothing to do, but with the play, responsibility, contribution, sacrifice, homemade, humility and other virtues closely linked. Only in the past and the unfortunate experience of reconciliation, we can overcome a variety of lack of sense, to restore their own power system, and in a steady stream of endless support with the inner power of the enterprise to bring one after another new peak.</p>
