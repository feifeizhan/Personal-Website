    <h1>how to become a master</h1>
    <p>A new book, called <strong>&lt;&lt;giant tools: billionaire, idol and world-class performers tactics, habits and daily&gt;&gt;</strong> This is a celebrity interview set, the author Felice visited about one or two hundred celebrities, and put their experience into a book. Weigang this selection of one of the master of writing. He is the author of the Dilbert comic book, Scott Adams, who writes his blog and draws comics and writes, especially high-yield, and self-contained. Weigang from his experience summed up a few tips to become a master, the following to tell you.</p>
    <p>The first, to develop a system, rather than care about the success or failure of small goals.Adams worked side by side, while adhering to amateur painting and writing. Although painting and writing on his overall material return is very small, but he has been insisting. Because he did not do anything at all to accomplish a goal, but to develop a system. &quot;Target&quot; is to say that this matter either succeeds or fails, is specific and definite. The &quot;system&quot; is to say that this thing is continuous change, can be a skill, it can be a relationship, is the continuous development. Adams in the blog when writing articles only concerned about the system can continue to develop.</p>
    <p><strong>How to develop the system?</strong> </p>
    <p>Adams did two things, the first is to <strong>write</strong> regularly, can not be three days fishing two days drying net. The second is that Adams used <strong>the blog as a research and development</strong> platform, where he did various writing techniques. For example, he will write different types of topics, will change the different language style, to see which one is more welcomed by readers. Blog more write more, Adams's writing system to grow up. Because he has formed a mature system in writing, he knows exactly how the article should be written. So, he later in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; opened a column, immediately on the popular.</p>
    <p>The second, to determine a worthless value, rather than listen to the brain, not as good as <strong>listening to the body</strong>.In order to maintain high frequency updates, Adams must have a lot of ideas and inspiration. Where did Adams inspiration come from?First of all, he got up every morning after the process of immobilization, even the breakfast is exactly the same. To do so, is to first of all yesterday's problems are left behind, the brain cleared. Then he turns on the computer again, read the news, read the article, find the material and inspiration. To judge what information is worth as a material, Adams has its own unique method of judgment. He said that you should not listen to the judgment of the brain, but should obey the body. For example, when you see a new message, is not involuntarily laughed, there is no strong emotional fluctuations. If the answer is yes, it means that it is a good material. Because if your body reacts strongly to this message, the reader will probably care about the thing.</p>
    <p>The third, in two or three areas, reached the <strong>top 25% level</strong>. Adams said that if you want to be a master in a field, you probably have two options. The <strong>first option</strong> is that you get <strong>your skills out of the world the best</strong>. This is very difficult, very few people can do it. The <strong>second option</strong> is that you can practice <strong>two or three skills</strong>, and then each skill is trained to the world's <strong>top 25%</strong> level, which is relatively easy. And if you can combine these two or even three skills to do one thing, you can achieve great success.</p>
    <p>Such as Adams himself. His <strong>painting skills</strong>, <strong>writing jokes skills<strong>, and understanding of &quot;</strong>office politics</strong>&quot; may not be the best in the world, but can reach the top 25% level. So he put these three skills together to create a &quot;Dilbert comics.&quot; This series of comics at the same time in 65 countries, using 25 languages, more than two thousand newspapers reproduced, very popular.</p>
    <p>So Adams's advice to young people is that whatever you really want is, you must **first get the top 25% **in this field, and then you stack the second and third areas. If you really do not know what the field to add, Adams suggested that <strong>the speech</strong>, because the speech can rely on efforts to fully grasp. Imagine if you are the top 25% of the programmer, your company has a lot of the top 25% of the programmer, but you are still a top 25% of the speakers. Then you will naturally become the leader of other programmers.</p>
    <p>Finally, the Weigang commented that it is conditional to develop a system. Not only need tolerance, such as do not care about the node type of career planning, no specific goals, regardless of return, do something for a long time, at the same time, also need a serious work and support around people. He is <strong>fortunate</strong> that he is equipped with these conditions.</p>
